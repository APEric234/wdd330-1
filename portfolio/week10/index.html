      </li>
      <li>Notes on Fetch
        <P>
          First jumped to request options since i am familiar with fetch since i do online data collection. 
          So if you pass a second variable to fetch it will be interpreted as the init varibale where you can set things like the method of request,headers,body data and soon.
        </P>
      </li>
