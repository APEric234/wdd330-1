    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
    <P>This week most of the wreading was review since most of this overlaps with the python knowledge i have from the last college
         i attended just learning new syntax. Though was excited to discover how to use functions in javascript since that really simplifies the code i have to write</P>
